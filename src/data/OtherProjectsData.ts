      <strong>Universal App Maker</strong> is the most significant academic project I've worked on. It is an <strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</strong> for people without prior knowledge of programming languages, allowing them to build <strong>Windows Universal Apps</strong> with simple graphical interactions (Drag and drop). <strong>Universal App Maker</strong> is closely similar to <strong>App Inventor</strong> by <strong>MIT</strong>, but it targets the <strong>Windows 8.1</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone 8.1</strong> platforms.
      <br/>This project was built using C#/WPF and the Universal Windows App framework.

      <strong>FinLabs</strong> is a digital training platform in the form of simulation on the capital market in general and specifically on the exchange market.

      <br/><strong>FinLabs</strong> Allow trainers to create virtual trading sessions where trainees can join as traders in virtual banks, so they can trade currencies with other traders or the central bank, compete between themselves to meet the market needs, navigate through the variables and events the trainer will send their way, and make the most profit for their bank.
